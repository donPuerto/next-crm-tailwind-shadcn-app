# 03 - Styling Standards (Tailwind)

## Rules
- Use utility-first classes; avoid custom CSS unless global or required.
- Keep class lists readable; group by layout → spacing → typography → color → effects.
- Avoid adding class helper libraries unless requested.

## Conventions
- Use `dark:` variants for dark mode when needed.
- Prefer semantic HTML with Tailwind for clarity.
