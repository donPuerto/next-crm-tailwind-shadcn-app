# 02 - Structure Standards

## Routing
- Routes live in `app/` using App Router conventions.
- Use `page.tsx` for pages, `layout.tsx` for layouts, `loading.tsx` for loading UI, `error.tsx` for error boundaries.

## Reuse & Organization
- Shared UI components live in `components/`.
- UI primitives live in `components/ui/`.
- Hooks live in `app/hooks/`.
- Shared utilities live in `lib/`.

## Consistency Rules
- Do not create new top-level folders without confirmation.
- Keep naming consistent and descriptive.
